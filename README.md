# instagram_bot
I created an Instagram bot using python, selenium, and chrome web driver. 
This script logs into an Instagram account and likes and comments on posts with a specific hashtag.
Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers.

## This can be done in various ways:
Permit it to tap on buttons.
Skim your site to check whether everything is okay.
Enter content in structures.
